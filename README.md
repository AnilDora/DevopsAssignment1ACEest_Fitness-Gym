---

## Automated Testing Configuration  

1. Added `pytest.ini` in the project root to configure test discovery.  
2. Now whenever you run:  
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```  
   it will automatically detect and run tests from the `tests/` folder.

---

## Pre-Commit Hook (Local Automation)  

1. Install pre-commit:  
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```
2. Add a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to the project root.  
3. Install hooks:  
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

---

## Containerization with Docker  

1. Added `requirements.txt` (Flask + pytest).  
2. Created `Dockerfile` for building the project image.  
3. Added `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.  
4. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
   docker build -t fitness-gym-app .
   ```
5. Pushing the Docker image with tag latest

   ```bash
   docker push fitness-gym-app:latest
   ```
